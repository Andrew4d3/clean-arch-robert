What did dijkstra say about "testing"?

---

Dijkstra once said, “Testing shows the presence, not the absence, of bugs.” In
other words, a program can be proven incorrect by a test, but it cannot be
proven correct. All that tests can do, after sufficient testing effort, is allow us
to deem a program to be correct enough for our purposes.
