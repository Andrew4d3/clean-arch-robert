What do programing paradigms have to do with architecture?

What does this history lesson on paradigms have to do with architecture?
Everything. We use polymorphism as the mechanism to cross architectural
boundaries; we use functional programming to impose discipline on the
location of and access to data; and we use structured programming as the
algorithmic foundation of our modules.
Notice how well those three align with the three big concerns of architecture:
function, separation of components, and data management
