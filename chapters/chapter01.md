According to "Clean Architecture" is there a difference bewteen "Architecture" and "Design"?

---

One of the goals of this book is to cut through all that confusion and to
define, once and for all, what design and architecture are. For starters, I’ll
assert that there is no difference between them. None at all.

Why is there no difference for "Architecture" and "Design"?

---

And so it is with software design. The low-level details and the high-level
structure are all part of the same whole. They form a continuous fabric that
defines the shape of the system. You can’t have one without the other; indeed,
no clear dividing line separates them. There is simply a continuum of
decisions from the highest to the lowest levels.

What's the goal of software architecture?

---

The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required
to build and maintain the required system.

What happens with productivity when systems are thrown together in a hurry?

---

Figure 1.4 shows what this curve looks like to the developers. They started
out at nearly 100% productivity, but with each release their productivity
declined. By the fourth release, it was clear that their productivity was going
to bottom out in an asymptotic approach to zero.

What's one of the problems of getting too overconfident and procrastinating the decision of writing well-designed code?

---

These developers buy into a familiar lie: “We can clean it up later; we just
have to get to market first!” Of course, things never do get cleaned up later,
because market pressures never abate. Getting to market first simply means
that you’ve now got a horde of competitors on your tail, and you have to stay
ahead of them by running as fast as you can.
